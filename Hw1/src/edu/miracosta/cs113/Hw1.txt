1) Since my program starts with a guess of 1,1,1 it only takes one try to get the first murder.
 The second murder takes 20 checks. 5 tries of the random solution takes [10,8,10,18,4] checks to get the correct solution.

2)The good thing about this stratagy is that if the murder is near the begining of the list my program will find them faster. 
The closer we get to the end of the list the longer it will take to get the solution.
